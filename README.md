# UTMFW

UTMFW is a UTM firewall running on OpenBSD. UTMFW is expected to be used on production systems. The UTMFW project provides a Web User Interface (WUI) for monitoring and configuration. You can also use the Android application [A4PFFW](https://github.com/sonertari/A4PFFW), which can display the notifications sent from UTMFW, and the Windows application [W4PFFW](https://github.com/sonertari/W4PFFW) for monitoring.

UTMFW is an updated version of ComixWall. However, there are a few major changes, such as [SSLproxy](https://github.com/sonertari/SSLproxy), Snort Inline IPS, [PFRE](https://github.com/sonertari/PFRE), E2Guardian, many fixes and improvements to the system and the WUI, Firebase push notifications, and network user authentication. Also note that UTMFW 7.2 comes with OpenBSD 7.2-stable including all updates until December 31st, 2022.

UTMFW supports the deep SSL inspection of HTTP, POP3, and SMTP protocols. SSL/TLS encrypted traffic is decrypted by [SSLproxy](https://github.com/sonertari/SSLproxy) and fed into the UTM services: Web Filter, POP3 Proxy, SMTP Proxy, and Inline IPS (and indirectly into Virus Scanner and Spam Filter through those UTM software). These UTM software have been modified to support the mode of operation required by SSLproxy.

## Download

The UTMFW project releases two installation files:

- The installation iso file for the amd64 arch is available for download at [utmfw72\_20221231\_amd64.iso](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eSxuIAS92TBbNOMEvqVZppFcbbrTbLlQ/view?usp=sharing). Make sure the SHA256 checksum is correct: 08360b7614bddfa1007b3beed9230662238ddc6240d072575df725088488fcd3.

- The installation img file for the arm64 arch is available for download at [utmfw72\_20221231\_arm64.img](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gmpPERzISD2c9hbQvzGlOVfr26rQr8PQ/view?usp=sharing). Make sure the SHA256 checksum is correct: 87b271f977768fdb731bc9722b5487ebfd8f1342f5f39300e39db3a7a3fd78e7. The only arm64 platform supported is Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

You can follow the instructions on [this OpenBSD Journal article](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20140225072408) to convert the installation iso file for the amd64 arch into a bootable image you can write on a USB drive or an SD card.

## Features

UTMFW includes the following software, alongside what is already available on a basic OpenBSD installation:

- E2Guardian: Web filter, anti-virus using ClamAV, blacklists
- Snort: Intrusion detection and inline prevention system, with the latest rules
- SnortIPS: Passive intrusion prevention software
- ClamAV: Virus scanner with periodic virus signature updates
- SpamAssassin: Spam scanner
- P3scan: Anti-virus/anti-spam transparent POP3 proxy
- Smtp-gated: Anti-virus/anti-spam transparent SMTP proxy
- Dante: SOCKS proxy
- IMSpector: IM proxy which supports IRC and others.
- OpenVPN: Virtual private networking
- Symon: System monitoring software
- Pmacct: Network monitoring via graphs
- Collectd: System metrics collection engine
- Dnsmasq: DNS forwarder
- PHP

![Console](https://github.com/sonertari/UTMFW/blob/master/screenshots/Console.png)

The web user interface of UTMFW helps you manage your firewall:

- Dashboard displays an overview of system status using graphs and statistics counters. You can click on those graphs and counters to go to their details on the web user interface.
- Notifier sends the system status as Firebase push notifications to the Android application, [A4PFFW](https://github.com/sonertari/A4PFFW).
- System, network, and service configuration can be achieved on the web user interface.
- Pf rules are maintained using [PFRE](https://github.com/sonertari/PFRE).
- Information on hosts, interfaces, pf rules, states, and queues are provided in tabular form.
- System, pf, network, and internal clients can be monitored via graphs.
- Logs can be viewed and downloaded on the web user interface. Compressed log files are supported.
- Statistics collected over logs are displayed in bar charts and top lists. Bar charts and top lists are clickable, so you don't need to touch your keyboard to search anything on the statistics pages. You can view the top lists on pie charts too. Statistics over compressed log files are supported.
- The web user interface provides many help boxes and windows, which can be disabled.
- Man pages of OpenBSD and installed software can be accessed and searched on the web user interface.
- There are two users who can log in to the web user interface. Unprivileged user does not have access rights to configuration pages, thus cannot interfere with system settings, and cannot even change user password (i.e. you can safely give the unprivileged user's password to your boss).
- The web user interface supports languages other than English: Turkish, Chinese, Dutch, Russian, French, Spanish.
- The web user interface configuration pages are designed such that changes you may have made to the configuration files on the command line (such as comments you might have added) remain intact after you configure a module using the web user interface.

UTMFW uses the same design decisions and implementation as the [PFRE](https://github.com/sonertari/PFRE) project. See its README for details.

## How to install

Download the installation iso or img file for your platform and follow the instructions in the installation guide available in the file. Below are the same instructions.

You can also find [the output of a sample installation on the wiki](https://github.com/sonertari/UTMFW/wiki/Sample-Installation).

### Installation Guide

UTMFW installation is very intuitive and easy, just follow the instructions on the screen and answer the questions asked. You are advised to accept the default answers to all the questions. In fact, the installation can be completed by accepting default answers all the way from the first question until the last. The only exceptions are network configuration, password setup, and installation disk selection.

Auto allocator will provide a partition layout recommended for your disk. Suggested partitioning should be suitable for most installations, simply accept it. Do not delete or modify the msdos partition (for arm64 installation).

Make sure you configure two network interfaces. You will be asked to choose internal and external interfaces later on. You can configure the internal wifi interface in Host AP mode.

All of the install sets and software packages are selected by default, simply accept the selections.

While installing using the img file, when the installation script asks the location for the install sets or the packages, you should choose the disk option and that the disk partition is not mounted yet, and then select the device name for the installation disk (usually sd0 or sd1, but type ? to see device info first). The default path for install sets and packages the script offers is the same path as in the img file too, so you just hit Enter at that point.

If the installation script finds an already existing file which needs to be updated, it saves the old file as filename.orig.

Installation logs can be found under the /root directory.

You can access the web administration interface using the IP address of the system's internal interface you have selected during installation. You can log in to the system over ssh from internal network.

Web interface user names are admin and user. Network user is utmfw. All are set to the same password you provide during installation.

### Installation Tips

A few notes about UTMFW installation:

- Thanks to a modified auto-partitioner of OpenBSD, the disk can be partitioned with a recommended layout for UTMFW, so most users don't need to use the label editor at all.
- All install sets including siteXY.tgz are selected by default, so you cannot 'not' install UTMFW by mistake.
- OpenBSD installation questions are modified according to the needs of UTMFW. For example, X11 related questions are never asked.
- Make sure you have at least 2GB RAM, ideally 4GB if you enable MFS. And an 8GB HD should be enough.
- If you install on an SD card, make sure it is fast enough. If you install on a slow disk, but you have enough RAM, you can enable memory-based file system (MFS), which is the default.
- After installation:
	+ When you first try to log in to the WUI, ignore the certificate warning issued by your web browser and proceed to the WUI.
	+ Download the ca.crt from the SSLproxy Config page on the WUI, and install it on your web browser or other client application as a trusted CA certificate. You can install the ca.crt in the trust store on Android phones, but Android applications may not use that trust store. So you may need to use the PassSite option of SSLproxy for such applications.
	+ Enable the pf rule for FCM ports (see /etc/pf.conf or go to the PFRE Editor page on the WUI), if you want to receive Firebase push notifications sent by UTMFW to your Android phone on the local network and on which you have installed and are running [A4PFFW](https://github.com/sonertari/A4PFFW).
- Make sure the date and time of the system is correct during both installation and normal operation. Set the system time to GMT time, not local time, before starting the installation, because the timezone of the system during installation is assumed to be GMT. Select the correct timezone during installation. For example, if your timezone is Turkey (GMT+3) and the current local time is 12:00 PM, then set the system time to 9:00 AM before starting the installation. Otherwise:
	+ The "Not Valid Before" date of the CA certificate generated for SSLproxy during installation may be wrong, causing clients to reject the certificates forged by SSLproxy, at least until the start date. To fix the "Not Valid Before" date, you may need to regenerate the CA certificate on the WUI, after fixing the system date and time.
	+ The certificates forged by SSLproxy will be rejected by client applications, hence the connections will fail.
	+ SSLproxy will not verify server certificates with date and time in the future or in the past, hence the connections will fail.
	+ After fixing the date and time of the system during normal operation, the system statistics and monitoring programs may stop updating the RRD files due to significant time difference since last update. So you may need to delete the statistics files and reinit the RRD files using the WUI, and restart either the statistics and monitoring programs or the system.

## How to build

The purpose in this section is to build the installation iso or img file using the createiso or createimg script, respectively, at the root of the project source tree. You are expected to be doing these on an OpenBSD 7.2 and have installed git, gettext, and doxygen on it.

### Build summary

The create script:

- Clones the git repo of the project to a tmp folder.
- Generates gettext translations and doxygen documentation.
- Prepares the webif and config packages and the site install set.
- And finally creates the iso file for the amd64 arch or the img file for the arm64 arch.

However, the source tree has links to OpenBSD install sets and packages, which should be broken, hence need to be fixed when you first obtain the sources. Make sure you see those broken links now. So, before you can run the create script, you need to do a couple of things:

- Install sets:
	+ Obtain the sources of OpenBSD.
	+ Patch the OpenBSD sources using the `patch-*` files under `openbsd/utmfw`.
	+ Create the UTMFW secret and public key pair to sign and verify the SHA256 checksums of the install sets, and copy them to their appropriate locations.
	+ Build an OpenBSD release, as described in [release(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/release) or [faq5](https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq5.html).
	+ Copy the required install sets to the appropriate locations to fix the broken links in the sources.
- Packages:
	+ Download the required packages available on the OpenBSD mirrors.
	+ Create the packages which are not available on the OpenBSD mirrors and/or have been modified for UTMFW: sslproxy, e2guardian, p3scan, smtp-gated, snort, imspector, snortips, and collectd (see `ports` and `ports/distfiles`).
	+ Copy them to the appropriate locations to fix the broken links in the sources.

Note that you can strip down xbase and xfont install sets to reduce the size of the iso and img files. Copy or link them to the appropriate locations under `openbsd/utmfw`.

Now you can run the createiso or createimg script, which should produce an iso or img file, respectively, in the same folder as itself.

### Build steps

The following are steps you can follow to build UTMFW yourself. Some of these steps can be automated by a script. You can modify these steps to suit your needs.

- Install OpenBSD amd64:
	+ Download installXY.iso from an OpenBSD mirror
	+ Create a new VM with 60GB disk, or choose a size based on your needs
	+ Start the VM and install OpenBSD

- Install OpenBSD arm64:
	+ Download installXY.img from an OpenBSD mirror
	+ Use a 32GB SD card or USB flash memory, or choose a size based on your needs
	+ Start the Raspberry Pi 4 or qemu-system-aarch64 and install OpenBSD

- Configure OpenBSD:
	+ Create a local user, after reboot add it to /etc/doas.conf
	+ Create a separate partition mounted on /dest, which will be needed to make release(8)
	+ Add noperm to /dest in /etc/fstab
	+ Make /dest owned by build:wobj and set its perms to 700
	+ Create /dest/dest/ and /dest/rel/ folders

- Fetch the UTMFW sources and update if upgrading:
	+ Install git
